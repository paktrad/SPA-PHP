# SPA-PHP
Here is the complete code for a single page application built in PHP with just a tinge of JavaScript. 
You can view the code at work at https://micro.webpub.pk/.
The design is inspired by Free HTML Templates as well as open source images are credited to the original author of the template in html/css/bootstrap.
The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate that PHP can be used to develop applications with simplified routing techniques and a little JavaScript to load content dynamically without having the need to reload entire page at each request.
